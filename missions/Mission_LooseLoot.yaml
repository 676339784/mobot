authors: [ Acbn ]
attr: DEX
reward: 40
info:  While mining in the multiverse, you notice another ship has been gone for quite a while, leaving behind a loose canister containing quite a large amount of unrefined ore.
success: You slyly sweep the canister into your cargo bay and slide into a less reputable trading base in the region, selling the canister for a healthy profit.
fail: Despite finding a way to scoop up the canister, the original owner returns much sooner than you expected.  He threatens to report you to the local authorities unless you return the canister plus a fee.
